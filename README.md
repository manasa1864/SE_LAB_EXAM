## Problem Statement

A mobility startup requires a ride-hailing platform that connects riders and drivers for on-demand transport. The system supports ride booking, real-time tracking, dynamic pricing, driver ratings, and secure payment processing.

The **Book Ride** use case allows a Rider to provide:

- Pickup location (`Rider_pick`)
- Drop / destination location (`Rider_dest`)
- Vehicle type — `BIKE / AUTO / SEDAN / SUV`

The system matches an available driver, calculates fare, and manages the complete ride lifecycle.

### 4. CRC Cards

**Entity — `Ride_details`**

| Responsibilities | Collaborations |
|---|---|
| Store login details of rider | `Login_rider` |
| Enter pickup location | `Rider_pick` |
| Enter destination location | `Rider_dest` |
| Enter vehicle type | `Vehicle` |
| Choice of driver | `Driver_decision` |
| Fare and ride history | `Fare`, `Ride_history`, `Receipt` |

**Boundary — `Dashboard`**

| Responsibilities | Collaborations |
|---|---|
| View driver's location | `Driver_loc_rider` |
| View driver's earnings | `Earning_dashboard` |
| View rider's ride history | `Ride_history` |
| View driver's trip history | `Trip_history` |

**Control — `Driver_finder`**

| Responsibilities | Collaborations |
|---|---|
| Get rider's location from pickup, search drivers | `Rider_movement`, `Driver_search_engine` |
| Driver accepts / rejects → match | `Driver_pick_engine` |
| Map leading driver to rider's location | `Driver_map_pick` |
| Driver authenticates rider, picks up to destination | `Driver_auth`, `Driver_map_dest` |

---

## Q2 — Implementation

### A.1 Implementation (10 Marks)

Implemented in **C++17** using OOP principles, based directly on the Q1 class model.

#### Classes

| Class | Type | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `Ride_details` | Entity | Core ride entity — stores all ride data, manages lifecycle |
| `Login_rider` | Entity | Rider authentication — login / logout |
| `Rider_pick` | Entity | Pickup location (name, latitude, longitude, distance calc) |
| `Rider_dest` | Entity | Drop / destination location |
| `Vehicle` | Entity | Vehicle type and registration number |
| `Fare` | Entity | Calculated fare with positive-value validation |
| `Receipt` | Entity | Prints ride receipt after completion |
| `Driver_decision` | Entity | Driver with single-active-ride enforcement |
| `Driver_finder` | Control | `match_driver()`, `Driver_AccorReject()` — matches driver to ride |
| `Dashboard` | Boundary | `showRideStatus()`, `showDriverLocation()` — display layer |

#### Custom Exceptions

| Exception | Thrown When |
|---|---|
| `RideException` | Base exception for all ride errors |
| `InvalidLocationException` | Location name is empty |
| `DriverNotAvailableException` | Driver offline, on ride, or vehicle type mismatch |
| `InvalidFareException` | Calculated fare is ≤ 0 |

#### Fare Calculation

```
Fare  =  (rate per km  ×  distance_km)  +  Rs. 20 base charge

  BIKE   →  Rs.  8 / km
  AUTO   →  Rs. 12 / km
  SEDAN  →  Rs. 18 / km
  SUV    →  Rs. 25 / km
```

## Black Box Testing

### ECP Partitions

| Location name | Non-empty string | Empty string `""` |
| Rider authentication | `loggedIn = true` | `loggedIn = false` |

## How to Run

```bash
g++ book_ride_full.cpp
./a.out
```

The program runs in three stages:

**Stage 1 — Demo Simulation**
Four live bookings showing the full ride flow — fare estimation, driver matching, ride lifecycle, receipt printing, and a cancel demo with `change_vehicle()`.

**Stage 2 — Test Suite**
15 Black Box + 15 White Box test cases printed in a formatted table with colour-coded PASS / FAIL results.

**Stage 3 — Coverage Reports**
Statement coverage, path coverage, condition coverage, and code coverage tables.
